# Deepfake-detection-GROUP14
The Deepfake Detection Project develops an AI system using CNNs, transfer learning, and adversarial training to detect deepfakes. It enhances accuracy with multi-modal features, GANs, and anomaly detection. The cloud-based solution supports real-time inference and uses XAI for transparency
